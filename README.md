# ImageHub

# Description
Tkinter-based Python GUI for basic image processing and computer vision. This is a work-in-progress.

Now, the following interface isn't exactly pretty, but it serves as a proof of concept for the interface. Once completed, the user will select their desired image transformation (e.g. edge detection, SVD-based compression), then they will choose an image from their file explorer to do this on. The GUI will provide instructions and fields for user-defined parameters along with image visualization.
